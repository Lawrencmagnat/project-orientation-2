Although the Steps is pre-defined using the comment command {//} but here it will be explained in details.

Steps
1) Creating of the parent class called AnimalKingdom; "line:5"

2) Using Using The Knowledge of Abstraction and polymorphism to create a constructor that throw err when called directly.
Note I commented it out, So that it will not continue to throw error as assigned to it. "line:10-14"

3)Using the Knowledge of Encapsulation to create a private property; Which can be assigned Using a mediator created in the step4.
Note An Encapsulation includes the idea that an object's data should not be directly exposed. Since all class properties is in public; to privatise it, u introduce "#".
The "#" when added to a class properties privatise it immediately in Js."line:17-22".

4)Still on Encapsulation; creation of the mediator that help us to grab out the properties of the hidden class;The mediator got access to the hidden through the aid of 
the "this"(line:25-30).

5)Creating a property call Cold and Endothermic_Animal which was assigned with the animal with hot $$ cold blood as our diagram said; "line:33-35"

6)Using the display command to display our class property outside the class "line:39-44" 
"Note:Since we want to be calling the properties inside the parent Class; we then use the method called 
display(with the name of the property to be displayed and also the "This"tag).The "This" Tag aids to grab and display to be the property inside a class(line:40-44).

Intanciating The parent class(line:52)
I call to reassigning(thats reassign it to a new class name.)

7)Creating the first Child class called  AnimalsWithBackBone that Inherited the property of the parent class AnimalKingdom.(line:57-95)
Note:That the child class when consoled with the parent property can display effectively 
because of the Inheritance relationship between the parent class and the child Class.


8)Creating another class called AnimalWithoutBackbone and reassign it to the our main class AnimalKingdom, That will also have the access to the main parent properties and has nothing to do
with the first child class because it did not inherit from it..It only acess the main class not the the child classes.(line:97-114);

 
9)Created Another class called Cold_Blooded and i wanted it to inherit the class property Of The inherited AnimalsWithBackBone class.But If continues showing Error.So i Created The
relationship using  Extends tag to inherit from our parent class AnimalKingdom(line:119-131);

10)Also created a class called Warm_Blooded  and extends to our main class,That is our parent class.
Note:You can call any property of the main class; as far as the child class inherited from the parent/main class. 





Note:Extends Creates a relationship between the Child class and the parent Class.
